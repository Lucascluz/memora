# GitHub Pages Setup Verification

## Current Repository Structure âœ…
- `/docs` folder with Jekyll documentation
- `_config.yml` properly configured
- `index.html` and `index.md` documentation files
- `Gemfile` for GitHub Pages dependencies
- No conflicting GitHub Actions workflows

## Steps to Fix GitHub Pages Configuration

### 1. Check Current Pages Settings
Go to: https://github.com/Lucascluz/memora/settings/pages

### 2. Configure for Branch Deployment
**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to select:
- **Source**: "Deploy from a branch" (NOT "GitHub Actions")
- **Branch**: "master" 
- **Folder**: "/docs"

### 3. If You See "GitHub Actions" Selected
If the source is currently set to "GitHub Actions":
1. Change it to "Deploy from a branch"
2. Select "master" branch
3. Select "/docs" folder
4. Click "Save"

### 4. Expected Result
After configuration, you should see:
- A green checkmark indicating successful deployment
- Your site URL: https://lucascluz.github.io/memora
- Build status showing Jekyll processing

### 5. Troubleshooting
If you still see errors:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to process the change
- Check that your repository is public
- Verify the /docs folder contains _config.yml
- Check that _config.yml has valid YAML syntax

## Test Your Documentation Locally
You can test the documentation locally by opening:
`/home/lucas/Projects/memora/docs/index.html`

This will show you exactly what will be displayed on GitHub Pages.
